# Review Verification System

## What is `isVerified` in Reviews Table?

The `isVerified` boolean field indicates whether a review has been verified as legitimate by the platform.

## Why Review Verification Matters

### 1. **Trust & Credibility** 🛡️
- Verified reviews come from users who actually used the CA's services
- Builds trust between users and CAs
- Helps users make informed decisions

### 2. **Spam & Fake Review Prevention** 🚫
- Prevents competitors from posting fake negative reviews
- Stops bots from inflating ratings
- Maintains platform integrity

### 3. **Legal Protection** ⚖️
- Helps prove reviews are genuine in case of disputes
- Protects platform from liability
- Ensures compliance with regulations

### 4. **Quality Control** ✅
- Allows admin to manually verify suspicious reviews
- Can be automated based on transaction history
- Filters out low-quality or irrelevant reviews

## How Reviews Get Verified

### Automatic Verification ✅
```javascript
// When user completes a paid consultation
async function completeConsultation(consultationId) {
  const consultation = await Consultation.findByPk(consultationId);
  
  // Auto-verify reviews from users who paid for services
  await Review.update(
    { isVerified: true },
    { 
      where: { 
        userId: consultation.userId,
        caId: consultation.caId,
        createdAt: { [Op.gte]: consultation.createdAt }
      }
    }
  );
}
```

### Manual Verification 🔍
```javascript
// Admin can manually verify reviews
async function verifyReview(reviewId, adminId) {
  await Review.update(
    { isVerified: true },
    { where: { id: reviewId } }
  );
  
  // Log admin action
  await AdminLog.create({
    adminId,
    action: 'VERIFY_REVIEW',
    targetId: reviewId
  });
}
```

## Using the Updated Helper Functions

### Get CA with Both Ratings
```javascript
const { getCAWithRating } = require('./utils/caRatingHelper');

const ca = await getCAWithRating(caId);

console.log('All Reviews:');
console.log(`Rating: ${ca.averageRating}/5`);
console.log(`Count: ${ca.reviewCount} reviews`);

console.log('Verified Reviews Only:');
console.log(`Rating: ${ca.verifiedRating}/5`);
console.log(`Count: ${ca.verifiedReviewCount} verified reviews`);
```

### Get CAs Prioritizing Verified Reviews
```javascript
const { getCAsOrderedByVerifiedRating } = require('./utils/caRatingHelper');

// Returns CAs sorted by:
// 1. Verified rating (if they have verified reviews)
// 2. Overall rating (fallback)
const topCAs = await getCAsOrderedByVerifiedRating({ limit: 10 });
```

### Get Recent Reviews (Verified Only)
```javascript
const { getRecentReviews } = require('./utils/caRatingHelper');

// Get last 5 verified reviews only
const verifiedReviews = await getRecentReviews(caId, 5, true);

// Get all recent reviews (verified and unverified)
const allReviews = await getRecentReviews(caId, 10, false);
```

## Display Strategy

### Frontend Display Options

#### Option 1: Show Both Ratings
```
★★★★☆ 4.2/5 (24 reviews)
🛡️ 4.5/5 (12 verified reviews)
```

#### Option 2: Prioritize Verified
```
★★★★☆ 4.5/5 (12 verified reviews)
All reviews: 4.2/5 (24 total)
```

#### Option 3: Badge System
```
★★★★☆ 4.2/5 (24 reviews) ✅ 50% verified
```

## Business Rules

### When to Auto-Verify
1. ✅ User completed paid consultation
2. ✅ User has transaction history with CA
3. ✅ Review posted within 30 days of service
4. ✅ User's account is phone/email verified

### When to Flag for Manual Review
1. 🔍 Multiple reviews from same IP
2. 🔍 Review contains suspicious keywords
3. 🔍 User has no transaction history
4. 🔍 Rating significantly different from user's other reviews
5. 🔍 Posted immediately after account creation

### Verification Workflow
```
New Review → Auto-Check Eligibility → If Eligible: Auto-Verify
                                   → If Not: Flag for Manual Review
                                   
Manual Review → Admin Decision → Verify/Reject/Delete
```

## Database Queries Examples

### Filter by Verification Status
```javascript
// Get only verified reviews for display
const verifiedReviews = await Review.findAll({
  where: { caId, isVerified: true },
  include: [{ model: User, as: 'user', attributes: ['name'] }],
  order: [['createdAt', 'DESC']]
});

// Get unverified reviews for admin moderation
const pendingReviews = await Review.findAll({
  where: { isVerified: false },
  include: [
    { model: User, as: 'user' },
    { model: CA, as: 'ca' }
  ]
});
```

### Calculate Trust Score
```javascript
// CA trust score based on verified review percentage
const trustMetrics = await Review.findOne({
  where: { caId },
  attributes: [
    [sequelize.fn('COUNT', '*'), 'totalReviews'],
    [sequelize.fn('COUNT', sequelize.case()
      .when({ isVerified: true }, 1)
      .else(null)), 'verifiedReviews'],
  ],
  raw: true
});

const trustScore = (trustMetrics.verifiedReviews / trustMetrics.totalReviews) * 100;
// 80%+ = High Trust, 50-79% = Medium Trust, <50% = Low Trust
```
